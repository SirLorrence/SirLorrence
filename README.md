### Professional Experience 

 I love learning in general! I'm a Linux Enthusiast, using it as my main OS for programming and gaming. Hella interested in video game technology/software and hardware (mainly thanks to [Digital Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalFoundry))

**Auto GFX -- Intel** 

Created a tool to install early version drivers for what's now called the Alchemist "Arc" GPUs. Using a mix of python and bat file scripting.

**OCR Data Extractor -- Intel** 

Created a tool that pulls FPS benchmark results data and other performance data from screenshots using Google's tesseract OCR and OpenCV, along with python.

**[Intergalactic Rescue](https://github.com/SirLorrence/Intergalactic-Rescue) -- Vigilance Digital Media** 

Release a casual mobile game on the Google Play store as a Game Programmer with a small team remotely from Nova Scotia. Assisting with project leads and assisted managing interns.

### Projects

**[Catch-Em](https://github.com/SirLorrence/Catch-Em)**

A recreation of the mini-game, "Hand Over Fish" from the game Jak and Daxter made in the Unity engine. I learned a little about shader graphs and a bit about graphics programming (not my jam).

**[Avoid it!](https://github.com/SirLorrence/Avoid_It)**

Developed a small game with C++ using the Raylibs graphics library. 

**[REHABILITATION](https://github.com/SirLorrence/REHABILITATION)** 

Created a six-axis space shooter. One of my first projects working with a team - at the Global Game Jam in Nova Scotia.
